# LinkedIn Skill Endorser 🚀

A robust, "human-like" JavaScript tool to automate endorsing skills on LinkedIn. It is designed to run in the browser console, handling dynamic loading, scrolling, and avoiding bot detection mechanisms by using random delays.

## Features

- **🛡️ Bot-Safe Delays**: Uses randomized human-like intervals between clicks (800ms - 2.5s) to avoid rate limiting.
- **👀 Visual Status Box**: Adds a floating overlay to the bottom-right of your screen so you can track progress without keeping the console open.
- **🔍 Smart Scroll Search**: Automatically scrolls down to find missing or virtualization-hidden skills if it hits a "gap" in the list.
- **🧹 Auto-Cleanup**: The status box automatically fades out and removes itself from the page after completion.
- **🔄 Smart Re-Query**: Automatically handles LinkedIn's dynamic DOM updates (stale element references) by finding the next button freshly each time.

## How to Use

1.  Open **LinkedIn** and navigate to the **Skills** section of a connection's profile.
    *   *Tip: Click "Show all skills" to view the full list first.*
2.  Open your browser's **Developer Console**:
    *   **Mac**: `Cmd` + `Option` + `J`
    *   **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `J`
3.  Copy the code from `index.js` and paste it into the console.
4.  Press **Enter**.
5.  Sit back! A box will appear in the bottom-right corner showing you the endorsement progress.
