A robust, "human-like" JavaScript tool to automate endorsing skills on LinkedIn. It is designed to run in the browser console, handling dynamic loading, scrolling, and avoiding bot detection mechanisms by using random delays.

## ✨ Features

- **🛡️ Bot-Safe Delays**: Uses randomized human-like intervals between clicks (800ms - 2.5s) to avoid rate limiting.
- **👀 Visual Status Box**: Adds a floating overlay to the bottom-right of your screen so you can track progress without keeping the console open.
- **🧠 Anti-Stuck Logic**: Smartly retries stubborn buttons up to 3 times before skipping them, preventing endless loops.
- **🔍 Smart Scroll Search**: Automatically scrolls down to find missing or virtualization-hidden skills if it hits a "gap" in the list.
- **🧹 Auto-Cleanup**: The status box automatically fades out and removes itself from the page after completion.
- **🔄 Smart Re-Query**: Automatically handles LinkedIn's dynamic DOM updates (stale element references) by finding the next button freshly each time.
